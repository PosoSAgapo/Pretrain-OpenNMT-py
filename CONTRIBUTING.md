We welcome any contribution to the code, but notify in advance, a contribution may not be merged if the contribution has sever conflicts with current codes.

Additionally, before you send a PR, you should comment your PR as much as possible and specify which bug you fix or which feature you add, please do not seed meaningless or uncommented PR as this would delay the process of reviewing your code and also a uncommented code hurts the readability of the code.
